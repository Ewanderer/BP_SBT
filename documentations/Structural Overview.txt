Our Teensy programm uses 3 interrupts:
	1. Reading of our Microphone every 0.25ms.
	2. Setting the current frequency.
	3. Generation of the signal tone(this is done via the framework)

Our main routine calculates the FFT and interprets the results based on our protocol, while also keeping in touch via the serial interface with our PC.
