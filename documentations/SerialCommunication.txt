Our Teensy is controlled by a PC connected via a Serial Interface(Baud=9600)
Teensy is listening for incoming commands, whenever it has downtime(i.e. recording a sample) or if it's buffer for outgoing transmissions is empty.
Our PC is always listening and sending if its buffer is not emtpy.
Because we don't want to wait endlessly on incoming transmissions  via the serial port on PC, we excpect a inital symbol(on the PC any symbol except 0).
All Transmissions are written in bytearrays, with the first byte being by a byte giving the length in byte of the transmission, followd a identifier for the type of transmission(i.E. status, error or transmission)
After that we are sending the Information

Our Signals from the Teensy to the PC:
1: 		Initalized Teensy, internal, PC pealse confirm you are listing
2,X:	Identification on Channel X.
3,X,Y:  Byte Y on Channel X.
4,X:	Free Channel X found, ready for transmissions.
5,X:	Error X occured 


Error-Codes:
1 - Sample Buffer is full
2 - Buffer for outgoing data is full

Status Structure:
1. Mode of Operation, see OperationModes.txt
2. Channel of Transmission, -1 if still looking.
3. Free Slots in Buffer for Serial Connection
4. Free Slots in Buffer for outgoing bits
5. Free Slots in Buffer for microphone sampels

 
 
Our Signal from the PC to the Teensy:
1: 		Serial connection established, procede with scanning transmissiosn.
2 X:	Start Transmission Mode on Channel X
3:		Stop all Services until recieving (1) again.
4 X:	Send X(Single Byte) via Sound.
